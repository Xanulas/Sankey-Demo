1. clone the repo
2. edit config/project_init.sh to contain your own project and output directories (SF = shared folder, it's the folder I use to access things from both my VM and windows)
3. source config/project_init.sh
4. source wrappers/sankey-one-month.sh
5. See how it works / add your own data in Data directory
